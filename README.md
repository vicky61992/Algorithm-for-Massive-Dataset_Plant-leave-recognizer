This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of two deep learning techniques,
ResNet and VGG16, for classifying plant leaves images. The ResNet model
achieved a maximum validation accuracy of 87.76% at epoch 17, while the
VGG16 model outperformed it with a higher training accuracy of 97.5% and
a testing accuracy of 89.09%. Based on the results, it can be concluded that
the VGG16 model performed better in terms of accuracy and is recommended
for use in this study. However, the choice of the model depends on various
factors such as the dataset size, computational resources, and specific study
requirements. This study demonstrates the potential of using deep learning
techniques and neural networks for plant leaves image classification, which
could have significant implications for fields such as agriculture, plant biology,
and environmental monitoring. The modelâ€™s high accuracy rate can aid in
identifying plant species accurately, making it easier for researchers, farmers,
and conservationists to track and monitor plant populations. We trained and
evaluated these models on a publicly available dataset consisting of images
of 12 different plant species.
