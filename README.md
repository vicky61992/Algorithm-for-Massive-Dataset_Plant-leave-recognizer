This report presents a deep learning-based approach for plant leaves classification
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective of this
study was to explore the effectiveness of deep learning models in accurately
classifying plant leaves and to compare the performance of two popular CNN
models, ResNet50 and VGG16. We trained and evaluated these models on a
publicly available dataset consisting of images of 12 different plant species.
Our results show that both models can achieve high accuracy in classifying
plant leaves, with ResNet50 performing better with a test accuracy of
96.2% compared to VGG16’s 89.1%. The ResNet50 model also had a lower
training time compared to VGG16. The study demonstrates the potential of
deep learning models in plant leaves classification, providing a more efficient
and accurate alternative to traditional manual identification methods. The
models’ ability to accurately classify plant leaves can aid in plant species
identification, monitoring plant growth, and detecting plant diseases. This
research can contribute to the development of automated plant classification
systems that can assist researchers, farmers, and environmentalists in their
work
