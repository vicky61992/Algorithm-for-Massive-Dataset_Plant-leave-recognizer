# Algorithm-for-Massive-Dataset_Plant-leave-recognizer

We trained and evaluated several CNN models using a publicly available
dataset of plant leaves images. The dataset consists of images of 12 different
plant, each with varying numbers of images.
Our results show that deep learning models, particularly CNNs, can
achieve high accuracy in classifying plant leaves. The best model we trained
achieved an accuracy of ”69%”. on the test set, outperforming other models’
performance. The model’s ability to accurately classify plant leaves can help
in plant species identification, monitoring plant growth, and detecting plant
diseases.
